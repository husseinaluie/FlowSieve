# About FlowSieve

**FlowSieve** is developed as an open resource by the [Complex Flow Group at the University of Rochester](http://www.complexflowgroup.com), under the sponsorship of the National Science Foundation and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration. 
Continued support for **FlowSieve** depends on demonstrable evidence of the codeâ€™s value to the scientific community. 
We kindly request that you cite the code in your publications and presentations. 
**FlowSieve** is made available under The Open Software License 3.0 (OSL-3.0) (see [the license file](\ref license1) or the human-readable summary at the end of the README), which means it is open to use, but requires attribution. 

The following citations are suggested:

## Community Guidelines

* **Contributing**
 * At the current stage of development, anyone seeking to contribute to the FlowSieve codebase is asked to contact the main developers (see *Seeking Support*) to discuss the best way to integrate their contributions. The codebase is maintained on GitHub, and contributions will ultimately result in merging commits into the main branch. 
 * It is recommended to use a forked repository for active development, since it allows testing in a separate environment before merging.
* **Reporting Issues** 
 * Please report issues using the GitHub issue tracking tools (https://github.com/husseinaluie/FlowSieve/issues). Issues can also be submitted by email (see *Seeking Support*), but the issue tracker is preferred.
* **Seeking Support**
 * The best way to obtain support is to contact *Hussein Aluie* or *Benjamin Storer* by email. Contact information is available at the Complex Flow Group webpage (http://www.complexflowgroup.com/people/).
