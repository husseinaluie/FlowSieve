## Community Guidelines

* **Contributing**
 * At the current stage of development, anyone seeking to contribute to the FlowSieve codebase is asked to contact the main developers (see *Seeking Support*) to discuss the best way to integrate their contributions. The codebase is maintained on GitHub, and contributions will ultimately result in merging commits into the main branch. 
 * It is recommended to use a forked repository for active development, since it allows testing in a separate environment before merging.
* **Reporting Issues** 
 * Please report issues using the GitHub issue tracking tools. Issues can also be submitted by email (see *Seeking Support*), but the issue tracker is preferred.
* **Seeking Support**
 * The best way to obtain support is to contact *Hussein Aluie* or *Benjamin Storer* by email. Contact information is available at the Complex Flow Group webpage (http://www.complexflowgroup.com/people/).
